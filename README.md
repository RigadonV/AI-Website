# AI-Website
A RPA Website created with the use of ai

The background images were made by utilizing midjourney ai, which is user prompt accepted though discord, it allows you to determine how crreative the AI is allowed to be as well as what version of Midjourney you would like to use ( currently there are 4 availible) The same prompt will get you vastly different images if you decide to prompt it twice, with very few creative restrictions you can request 8k images as well. Ultimately some images when compared to their real world counterparts can be determined that they are not carbon copies in like-hood, however the creativity AI can use has a very fun element to it. Midjourney was used to generate two background images for the website.

Finally ChatGPT was used for all of the coding, Javascript, CSS and HTML completely generated by ChatGPT as well as all of the content that was used within the website.With this being said ChatGPT is a very powerfull tool for programmers, but i highly doubt that it will replace programmers, but it will become a part of a programmers arsenal of tools to create.
